# To specify which MATLAB release to install in the container, edit the value of the MATLAB_RELEASE argument.
# Use lower case to specify the release, for example: ARG MATLAB_RELEASE=r2021b
ARG MATLAB_RELEASE=r2023b

# Specify the extra toolboxes to install into the image.
ARG ADDITIONAL_PRODUCTS="Parallel_Computing_Toolbox"

# This Dockerfile builds on the Ubuntu-based mathworks/matlab image.
# To check the available matlab images, see: https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab

# By default, the MATLAB container runs as user "matlab". To modify the MATLAB installation in the image, switch to root.

# When running the container a license file can be mounted,
# or a license server can be provided as an environment variable.
# For more information, see https://hub.docker.com/r/mathworks/matlab

# Alternatively, you can provide a license server to use
# with the docker image while building the image.
# Specify the host and port of the machine that serves the network licenses 
# if you want to bind in the license info as an environment variable.
# You can also build with something like --build-arg LICENSE_SERVER=27000@MyServerName,
# in which case you should uncomment the following two lines.
# If these lines are uncommented, $LICENSE_SERVER must be a valid license
# server or browser mode will not start successfully.
